# Asteroids Game 3D

This is a prototype of Atari's Asteroids game, exactly like the last project (check out my `Asteroids_Game` repository), **but instead of using SDL2 (2D library), OpenGL (3D library) is used**. In other words, this is a remake of `Asteroids_Game` prototype, but this time in *3D* instead of 2D. The purpose of this project is to learn building games using OpenGL library, as well as to learn various game architecture techniques and game object models. 

This project is part of a book that I'm currently reading (see below for name of the book).

## Technologies Used

Languages and libraries used for this project include, Python, shader language, SDL2 (to initialize OpenGL), and OpenGL for 3D graphics. For the organization of classes, a technique that mixes *hierarchy game object model* and *composition game object model* is applied. 

## Demonstration

See my `Asteroids_Game` repository for demonstration.


Note: All source code for this game prototype can be found inside `.py` files.

*The book I'm currently reading for this project is called, **Game Programming in C++**.*
